# LAEMP

**the version hosted on github is somewhat old, this will be fixed asap**

LÃ„MP is a Zigbee controllable RGBY + W spot, which can be soldered at home and is easy to assemble. The extra yellow channel gives a much wider dynamic.

I still need to release the fw, if you need/want it right away, ping me! It is no secret, just messy :D
